# AutoRefresh
AutoRefresh is a simple brackets-like auto refresher for your local website.

It is similar to [logankoester's autorefresh](https://github.com/logankoester/autorefresh), but based on python3 and it should automagically detect files to detect changes to.

The modifications are detected using pyinotify, and the http/websocket server is implemented by hand using sockets.

This is quite early stage, there is no simple way to install this at the time, but it should work.
